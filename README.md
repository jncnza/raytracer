# raytracer
Ray tracing library written in Python 3.8, based on Peter Shirley's book *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)* and Arun Rocks' [Building a Ray Tracer in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCe63v4D_Q&list=PL8ENypDVcs3H-TxOXOzwDyCm5f2fGXlIS) series.

**TO DO:** rewrite in C++ because Python is not good for this and I need to stop using Python for everything.
